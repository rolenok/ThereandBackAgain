Implementation of 13 dwarves in C/C++

 +++++++++LEGEND++++++++++
* (ideal) --> code is composed, commented and executes properly with no bugs (having been repeatedly tested)
* (excellent) --> code is composed and excecutes properly with no known bugs
* (good) --> code is not quite composed but executes properly with no known bugs
* (fair) --> code is not composed and has a few bugs 
* (sloppy) --> code is not composed and has major bugs or incorrect output.
* (bad) --> code is not composed and has runtime errors and/or compile-time errors.
* (incomplete) --> the code has no obvious structure or goal.
* (*) --> Currently no known benchmark

The Thirteen Dwarves: 
1. Dense Linear Algebra --> heatDistribution.cpp (fair)
2. Sparse Linear Algebra --> Bifur.cpp (incomplete)
3. Spectral Methods/FFT --> ?
4. N-body Methods, Fast Multipole Methodse --> needs renaming --> ?
5. Structured Grids --> ?
6. Unstructured Grids --> ?
7. Monte Carlo --> mc-pi.c (not going to worry about this one)...
8. Combinational Logic --> ?
9. Graph Traversal --> ? (Some kind of search)
10. Graphical Models --> Bayesian Networks, Hidden Markov Models (*)
11. Finite-State Machines --> ? (*)
12. Dynamic Programming --> ? (*)
13. Backtrack and Branch-and-Bound -->  (*)
